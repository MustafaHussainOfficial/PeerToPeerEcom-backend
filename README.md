# E-commerce Backend API

This is the backend API for the E-commerce React application. The API is responsible for a variety of tasks including user authentication, product management, order processing, and more. The API is built using FastAPI, a modern, fast (high-performance), web framework for building APIs with Python 3.7+ based on standard Python type hints.

The API uses SQLAlchemy to interact with the database. The database is currently SQLite, but it can be easily swapped out for a different database if needed. The API uses JWT tokens for authentication. The token is sent in the Authorization header of the request.

The API is documented using OpenAPI and can be viewed at http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs when the API is running locally. The API also supports CORS and is designed to be highly scalable and performant.
